"one of the other reviewer have mention that after watch just 1 Oz episode you will be hooked . they be right , as this be exactly what happen with I . the first thing that strike I about Oz be its brutality and unflinching scene of violence , which set in right from the word GO . trust I , this be not a show for the faint hearted or timid . this show pull no punch with regard to drug , sex or violence . its be hardcore , in the classic use of the word . it be call OZ as that be the nickname give to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary . it focus mainly on Emerald City , an experimental section of the prison where all the cell have glass front and face inwards , so privacy be not high on the agenda . Em City be home to many .. Aryans , Muslims , gangsta , Latinos , Christians , Italians , Irish and more .... so scuffle , death stare , dodgy dealing and shady agreement be never far away . I would say the main appeal of the show be due to the fact that it go where other show would not dare . forget pretty picture paint for mainstream audience , forget charm , forget romance ... OZ do not mess around . the first episode I ever see strike I as so nasty it be surreal , I could not say I be ready for it , but as I watch more , I develop a taste for Oz , and get accustom to the high level of graphic violence . not just violence , but injustice ( crook guard who will be sell out for a nickel , inmate who will kill on order and get away with it , well mannered , middle class inmate be turn into prison bitch due to their lack of street skill or prison experience ) watch Oz , you may become comfortable with what be uncomfortable viewing .... thats if you can get in touch with your dark side .",1,1,0.5134143492406729
"a wonderful little production . the filming technique be very unassuming- very old - time - BBC fashion and give a comforting , and sometimes discomforting , sense of realism to the entire piece . the actor be extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only "" have get all the polari "" but he have all the voice down pat too ! you can truly see the seamless editing guide by the reference to Williams ' diary entry , not only be it well worth the watching but it be a terrificly write and perform piece . a masterful production about one of the great master 's of comedy and his life . the realism really come home with the little thing : the fantasy of the guard which , rather than use the traditional ' dream ' technique remain solid then disappear . it play on our knowledge and our sense , particularly with the scene concern Orton and Halliwell and the set ( particularly of their flat with Halliwell 's mural decorate every surface ) be terribly well do .",1,1,0.5235707191868176
"I think this be a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend , sit in the air condition theater and watch a light - hearted comedy . the plot be simplistic , but the dialogue be witty and the character be likable ( even the well bread suspect serial killer ) . while some may be disappoint when they realize this be not Match Point 2 : Risk Addiction , I think it be proof that Woody Allen be still fully in control of the style many of we have grow to love . this be the most I would laugh at one of Woody 's comedy in year ( dare I say a decade ? ) . while I have never be impress with Scarlet Johanson , in this she manage to tone down her "" sexy "" image and jump right into a average , but spirited young woman . this may not be the crown jewel of his career , but it be witty than "" Devil wear Prada "" and more interesting than "" Superman "" a great comedy to go see with friend .",1,1,0.5675785367850844
"basically there be a family where a little boy ( Jake ) think there be a zombie in his closet & his parent be fight all the time . this movie be slow than a soap opera ... and suddenly , Jake decide to become Rambo and kill the zombie . ok , first of all when you be go to make a film you must decide if it a thriller or a drama ! as a drama the movie be watchable . parent be divorce & argue like in real life . and then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruin all the film ! I expect to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie , and instead I watch a drama with some meaningless thriller spots.3 out of 10 just for the well play parent & descent dialog . as for the shot with Jake : just ignore they .",0,1,0.5006661522633745
"Petter Mattei 's "" love in the time of money "" be a visually stunning film to watch . Mr. Mattei offer we a vivid portrait about human relation . this be a movie that seem to be tell we what money , power and success do to people in the different situation we encounter . this be a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler 's play about the same theme , the director transfer the action to the present time New York where all these different character meet and connect . each one be connect in one way , or another to the next person , but no one seem to know the previous point of contact . stylishly , the film have a sophisticated luxurious look . we be take to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat . the only thing one get out of all these soul in the picture be the different stage of loneliness each one inhabit . a big city be not exactly the good place in which human relation find sincere fulfillment , as one discern be the case with most of the people we encounter . the acting be good under Mr. Mattei 's direction . Steve Buscemi , Rosario Dawson , Carol Kane , Michael Imperioli , Adrian Grenier , and the rest of the talented cast , make these character come alive . we wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work .",1,1,0.5549172030641164
"probably my all - time favorite movie , a story of selflessness , sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause , but it be not preachy or boring . it just never get old , despite my having see it some 15 or more time in the last 25 year . Paul Lukas ' performance bring tear to my eye , and Bette Davis , in one of her very few truly sympathetic role , be a delight . the kid be , as grandma say , more like "" dress - up midget "" than child , but that only make they more fun to watch . and the mother 's slow awakening to what be happen in the world and under her own roof be believable and startling . if I have a dozen thumb , they would all be "" up "" for this movie .",1,1,0.533357785467128

"this show be an amazing , fresh & innovative idea in the 70 ' when it first air . the first 7 or 8 year be brilliant , but thing drop off after that . by 1990 , the show be not really funny anymore , and it be continue its decline far to the complete waste of time it be today . it be truly disgraceful how far this show have fall . the writing be painfully bad , the performance be almost as bad - if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest - host , this show probably would not still be on the air . I find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand - select the original cast also choose the band of hack that follow . how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity ? I feel I must give 2 star out of respect for the original cast that make this show such a huge success . as it be now , the show be just awful . I can not believe it be still on the air .",0,1,0.51706936226167

I have see 950 + film and this be truly one of the bad of they - it be awful in almost every way : editing , pacing , storyline , ' acting , ' soundtrack ( the film 's only song - a lame country tune - be play no less than four time ) . the film look cheap and nasty and be boring in the extreme . rarely have I be so happy to see the end credit of a film . the only thing that prevent I give this a 1 - score be Harvey Keitel - while this be far from his good performance he at least seem to be make a bit of an effort . one for Keitel obsessive only .",0,1,0.5176869663011378

"Phil the Alien be one of those quirky film where the humour be base around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchline . at first it be very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progress I do not find the joke or oddness funny anymore . it a low budget film ( that s never a problem in itself ) , there be some pretty interesting character , but eventually I just lose interest . I imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who be currently partake . for something similar but well try "" brother from another planet """,0,1,0.506031391723356
"I see this movie when I be about 12 when it come out . I recall the scary scene be the big bird eat man dangle helplessly from parachute right out of the air . the horror . the horror . as a young kid go to these cheesy b film on Saturday afternoon , I still be tired of the formula for these monster type movie that usually include the hero , a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster die in the end . I do not care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plot . I love they now for the unintentional humor . but , about a year or so later , I see Psycho when it come out and I love that the star , Janet Leigh , be bump off early in the film . I sit up and take notice at that point . since screenwriter be make up the story , make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well - wear formula . there be no rule .",0,1,0.5122019334049409
"so I m not a big fan of Boll 's work but then again not many be . I enjoy his movie Postal ( maybe I m the only one ) . Boll apparently buy the right to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself be even finsishe . People who have enjoy kill merc and infiltrate secret research lab locate on a tropical island should be warn , that this be not Far Cry ... this be something Mr Boll have scheme together along with his legion of schmuck .. feel loneley on the set Mr Boll invite three of his countryman to play with . these player go by the name of Til Schweiger , Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller . three name that actually have make they self pretty big in the movie biz . so the tale go like this , Jack Carver play by Til Schweiger ( yes Carver be german all hail the bratwurst eat dude ! ! ) however I find that Tils act in this movie be pretty badass .. People have complain about how he be not really stay true to the whole Carver agenda but we only see carver in a first person perspective so we do not really know what he look like when he be kick a * * .. however , the storyline in this film be beyond demented . we see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger play by Udo Kier , make Genetically - mutate - soldier or GMS as they be call . perform his top - secret research on an island that remind I of "" SPOILER "" Vancouver for some reason . that s right no palm tree here . instead we get some nice rich lumberjack - wood . we have not even go far before I start to cry ( mehehe ) I can not go on any more .. if you wanna stay true to Bolls shenanigan then go and see this movie you will not be disappoint it deliver the true Boll experience , mean most of it will suck . there be some thing worth mention that would imply that Boll do a good work on some area of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scene . until the whole cromed / albino GMS squad enter the scene and everything just make I laugh .. the movie Far Cry reek of scheisse ( that be poop for you simpleton ) from a fa , r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead ..

I appreciate that this be try to bring Shakespeare to the masse , but why ruin something so good . be it because ' the scottish play ' be my favorite Shakespeare ? I do not know . what I do know be that a certain Rev Bowdler ( hence bowdlerization ) try to do something similar in the victorian era . in other word , you can not improve perfection .

"kind of draw in by the erotic scene , only to realize this be one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bit of film I have ever see . sort of like a high school film project . what be Rosanna Arquette think ? ? and what be with all those stock character in that bizarre supposed Midwest town ? pretty hard to get involve with this one . no lesson to be learn from it , no brilliant insight , just stilted and quite ridiculous ( but lot of skin , if that intrigue you ) videotape nonsense .... what be with the bisexual relationship , out of nowhere , after all the heterosexual encounter . and what be with that absurd dance , with everybody play their stereotyped role ? give this one a pass , it be like a million other mile of bad , waste film , money that could have be spend on starve child or Aids in Africa .....",0,1,0.5054753171856978
"some film just simply should not be remade . this be one of they . in and of itself it be not a bad film . but it fail to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title . Liam Neeson be excellent as he always be , and most of the cast hold up , with the exception of Owen Wilson , who just do not bring the right feel to the character of Luke . but the major fault with this version be that it stray too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it 's attempt to be grandiose and lose some of the thrill of the early film in a trade off for snazzy special effect . again I will say that in and of itself it be not a bad film . but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the old version much more .",1,1,0.558305683106576

I have no emotional attachment ( except to the big bad machine that want to destroy they ) scene be blatantly steal from other movie , LOTR , Star Wars and Matrix . example > the ghost scene at the end be steal from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda , Obee One and Vader . > the spider machine in the beginning be exactly like Frodo be attack by the spider in Return of the Kings . ( Elijah Wood be the victim in both film ) and wait ...... it hypnotize ( sting ) its victim and wrap they up ..... uh hello????>and the whole machine vs. human theme be the Matrix .. or Terminator ..... there be more example but why waste the time ? and will someone tell I what be with the Nazi 's ? ! ? !

"an awful film ! it must have be up against some real stinker to be nominate for the Golden Globe . they have take the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and mangle it beyond recognition . my complaint be not that they have take liberty with the fact ; if the story be good , that would perfectly fine . but it be simply bizarre -- by all account the true story of this artist would have make for a far well film , so why do they come up with this dishwater - dull script ? I suppose there be not enough naked people in the factual version . it be hurriedly cap off in the end with a summary of the artist 's life -- we could have save ourselves a couple of hour if they have favor the rest of the film with same brevity .",0,1,0.509261474609375
"after the success of Die Hard and it 's sequel it be no surprise really that in the 1990 , a glut of ' Die Hard on a .....

Cliffhanger be one big nit - picker dream , especially to those who be expert at mountain climbing , base - jumping , aviation , facial expression , acting skill . all in all it be full of excuse to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk . Stallone even manage to get out - act by a horse ! however , if you an forget all the nonsense , it be actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that deliver as plenty of thrill , and unintentionally , plenty of laugh . you've get to love John Lithgows sneery evilness , his tick every box band of baddie , and good of all , the permanently harassed and hapless ' turncoat ' agent , Rex Linn as Travers . he may of be Henry in ' Portrait of a serial Killer ' but Michael Rooker be noteworthy for a cringe - worthy performance as Hal , he insist on constantly shriek in painful disbelief at his captor ' that man never hurt anybody ' and whilst he surely can not be , it really do look like Ralph Waite 's Frank character be grin as the girl plummet to her death . mention too must go to former ' London 's Burning ' actor Craig Fairbrass as the brit bad guy , who come a cropper whilst use Hal as a Human Football , yes , you can not help enjoy that bit , Hal need a good kicking . so forget your well judgement , who care if ' that could never happen ' , lower your acting expectation , turn up the volume and enjoy ! and if you be look for Qaulen , he be the one wear the helicopter .",1,1,0.5067603380182294

this be the bad movie I see at WorldFest and it also receive the least amount of applause afterwards ! I can only think it be receive such recognition base on the amount of know actor in the film . it be great to see J.Beals but she be only in the movie for a few minute . M.Parker be a much well actress than the part allow for . the rest of the acting be hard to judge because the movie be so ridiculous and predictable . the main character be totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch . there be no real emotional depth to the story . a movie revolve about an actor who can not get work do not feel very original to I . nor do the development of the cop . it feel like one of many straight - to - video movie I see back in the 90 ... and not even a good one in those standard .,0,1,0.5016483729338843

""" the Cell "" be an exotic masterpiece , a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer , but also into one of a very talented director . this be conclusive evidence of what can be achieve if human being unleash their uninhibited imagination . this be boldness at work , push aside thought to fall into formula and cliche and create something truly magnificent . this be the good movie of the year to date . i've read numerous complaint about this film , anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast character and bad acting . to negatively criticize this film be to miss the point . this movie may be a landmark , a tradition where future movie will hopefully follow . "" the cell "" have just open the door to another world of imagination . so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we do not want any more ? personally , I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem , and would love to see someone try to challenge he . we've all hear talk about go inside the mind of a serial killer , and yes , I do agree that the "" genre "" be a bit overworked . the 90 be full of movie try to depict what make serial killer tick ; some of they work , but most fail . but "" the Cell "" do not blaze down the same trail , we be give a new twist , we be physically transport into the mind and present with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever study . I like how the movie do not bog we down with too much scientific jargon try to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually get to enter the brain of another . instead , she just lie down on a laboratory table and be wrap with what look like really long Twizzlers and jaunt into another entity .

I notice how the film be very dark when it show reality , maybe to contrast the bright visual when inside the brain of another . nonetheless , the set design be simply astonishing . I would not be surprised if this film take home a few Oscars in cinematography , good costume , good director and the like . if it be up to I it would at least get nominate for good picture . i've notice that I have kind of be repeat myself . not because there be nothing else to say , but because I can not stress enough how fantastic I think "" the Cell "" be . if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it take over with wonder and an eye - pop feast then you be assure a good time . I guess this film be just a little too much for some people , write it off as "" weird "" or "" crazy "" . I be very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind , so it be right down my alley . leave the theater , I hear one audience member say "" whoever make that movie sure do a lot of good drug .

"war movie ' be a Hollywood genre that have be do and redo so many time that clichéd dialogue , rehash plot and over - the - top action sequence seem unavoidable for any conflict deal with large - scale combat . once in a while , however , a war movie come along that go against the grain and bring a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen . the Civil War - era "" Cold Mountain , "" star Jude Law , Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger be such a film . then again , call Cold Mountain "" a war movie be not entirely accurate . true enough , the film open with a ( quite literally ) quick - and - dirty battle sequence that put "" Glory "" director Edward Zwick shame . however , "" Cold Mountain "" be not so much about the Civil War itself as it be about the period and the people of the time . the story center around disgruntled confederate soldier Inman , play by Jude Law , who become disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain , North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he leave behind , Ada Monroe , play by Nicole Kidman . at first glance , this setup appear formulaic as the romantic interest back home give the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier 's tribulation on the battlefield . indeed , the early segment of the film be relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived . ""Cold Mountain "" soon take a drastic turn , though , as the intrepid hero Inman turn out to be a deserter ( incidentally save the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of want to root for the Confederates ) and begin a long odyssey homeward . meanwhile , back at the farm , Ada 's cultured way prove of little use in the field ; soon she be transform into something of a wilderbeast . come to Ada 's rescue be the course , tough - as - nail Ruby Thewes , play by Renée Zellweger , who help Ada put the farm back together and , perhaps more importantly , cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seem to have bring upon Ada . within these two setting , a vivid , compelling and , at time , very disturbing portrait of the war - tear South unfold . the character with whom Inman and Ada interact be surprisingly complex , enhance by wonderful performance of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby 's deadbeat father , Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern "" lawman , "" and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother . all have be greatly affect and change by "" the war of northern aggression , "" mostly for the bad . the dark , pervade anti - war message , accent by an effective , haunting score and chillingly beautiful shot of Virginia and North Carolina , be communicate to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scene as by the scar land and traumatize people for which the war be fight . though the weapon and tactic of war itself have change much in the past century , it 's hellish effect on the land be timelessly relevant . director Anthony Minghella manage to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film , but the atmosphere be unfortunately denigrate by a rather tepid climax that do little justice to the wonderfully form character . the love story between Inman and Ada be awkwardly tack onto the beginning and end of the film , though the inherently distant , abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fit the dismal nature of the rest of the plot . make no mistake , "" Cold Mountain "" have neither the trait of a feel - good romance nor an inspiring war drama . it be a unique vision of an era that be sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the life of a people tear apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussion altogether .",1,1,0.500586238781192

Gloria Grahame give her first fully - fledge rendition of the smart - mouthed , vulnerable tramp , and , as a sad sack who be leech into her life , Paul Kelly haunt we in a small , peripheral role that he make memorable . the politically engage Dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumb to sermonizing , but it be pretty much confine to Young 's reminiscence of how his irish grandfather die at the hand of bigot a century early ( thus , incidentally , stretch chronology to the limit ) . at least there be no attempt to render an explanation , however glib , of why Ryan hate Jews ( and hillbilly and ... ).curiously , Crossfire survive even the major change work upon it -- the novel it be base on ( Richard Brooks ' the Brick Foxhole ) deal with a gay - bash murder . but homosexuality in 1947 be still Beyond the Pale . news of the Holocaust have , however , begin to emerge from the ashe of Europe , so Hollywood feel emboldened to register its protest against anti - semitism ( the studio always quake at the prospect of offend any potential ticket buyer).but while the change from homophobia to anti - semitism work in general , the specific do not fit so smoothly . the victim 's chat up a lonesome , drunk young soldier then invite he back home look odd , even though ( or especially since ) there be a girlfriend in tow . it raise the question whether this scenario be retain inadvertently or leave in as a discreet tip - off to the original engine generate Ryan 's murderous rage .",1,1,0.5044207106479021

"one of the most significant quote from the entire film be pronounce halfway through by the protagonist , the mafia middle - man Titta Di Girolamo , a physically non - descript , middle - aged man originally from Salerno in Southern Italy . when we be introduce to he at the start of the film , he be be live a non - life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian - speak Canton of Switzerland for the last ten year , conduct a business we be only gradually introduce to . while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene take place employee of the the swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamo 's cash tell he that 10,000 dollar be miss from his usual suitcase full of tightly stack banknote . at the news , he quietly but icily threaten his coax bank manager of want to close down his account . meanwhile he tell we , the spectator , that when you bluff , you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of be catch out or appear ridiculous . he say : you can not bluff for a while and then halfway through , tell the truth . having eventually do this - bluff only halfway through and tell the truth , and having accept the consequence of life and ultimately , love - be exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo 's trouble . this initially unsympathetic character , a scowling , taciturn , curt man on the verge of 50 , a man who will not even reply in kind to chambermaid and waitress who say hello and goodbye , become at one point someone the spectator care deeply about . at one point in his non - life , Titta decide to feel concern about appear "" ridiculous "" . the first half of the film may be describe as "" slow "" by some . it do indeed reveal Di Girolamo 's day and night in that hotel at an oddly disjoined , deliberate pace , reveal seemingly mundane and irrelevant detail . however , scene that may have seem unnecessary reveal just how essential they be as this masterfully construct and innovative film unfold before your eye . the existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man with no imagination , identity or life , the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up love and feel for when you least think you would - be also convey with elegantly edit sequence and very interesting use of music ( one theme by the scottish band Boards of Canada especially stand out ) . never be the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobster more at odd than since the release of film such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore . another interesting element be the way in which the film make use of the protagonist 's insomnia . not unlike the Machinist ( and in a far more explicit way , the Al Pacino film Insomnia ) , Le Conseguenze dell'Amore use this condition to symbolise a deep emotional malaise that be be ram so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious , it be almost impossible to pin - point its cause ( if indeed there be one ) . the young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia ( play by Olivia Magnani , grand - daughter of the legendary Anna ) and the memory of Titta 's good friend , a man whom he have not see in 20 year , unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually ( though tentatively at first ) accept to look through again . though it be never explicitly spell out , the spectator know that to a man like Titta , accept the consequence of Love will have unimaginable consequence . a film without a single scene of sex or violence , a film that unfold in its own time and concede nothing to the spectator 's expectation , Le Conseguenze dell'Amore be a fine representative of that small , quiet , discreet Renaissance that have be take place in italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà during the second half of the 70 . the world be wait for Italy to produce more Il Postino - like fare , more La Vita è Bella - style film ... neglect to explore fine creation like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore , L'Imbalsamatore and other . your loss , world .",1,1,0.5298695303493526

"Preston Sturgis ' the POWER and the GLORY be unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty year until the late 1990 when it resurface and even show up on television . in the meantime it have gain in notoriety because Pauline Kael 's the CITIZEN KANE BOOK have suggest that the Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles screenplay for KANE be base on Sturgis ' screenplay here . as be mention in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site , Kael overstate her case . there be about six narrator who take turn deal with the life of Charles Foster Kane : the newsreel ( represent Ralston - the Henry Luce clone ) , Thatcher 's memoir , Bernstein , Jed Leland , Susan Alexander Kane , and Raymond the butler . each have his or her different slant on Kane , reflect their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man . and of course each also reveal his or her own failing when they be tell their version of Kane 's story . this method also lead to frequent overlapping re - telling of the same incident . this be not the situation in the power and the glory . yes , like KANE it be about a legendary business leader - here it be Tom Garner ( Spencer Tracy ) , a man who rise from the bottom to be head of the most successful railroad system in the country . but there be only two narrator - they be Garner 's right hand man Henry ( Ralph Morgan ) and his wife ( Sarah Padden ) . this restrict the nearly three dimensional view we get at time of Kane in Garner . Henry , when he narrate , be talk about his boss and friend , whom he respect and love . his wife be like the voice of the skeptical public - she see only the flaw in Henry . typical example : although he work his way up , Tom become more and more anti - labor in his later year . union be troublemaker , and he do not care to be slow down by their shenanigan . Henry describe Tom 's confrontation with the Union in a major walk - out , and how it preoccupy he to the detriment of his home life . but Henry 's wife remind he how Tom use scab and violence to end the strike ( apparently blow up the Union 's headquarters - kill many people ) . so we have two view of the man but one be pure white and one be pure black . i'm not really knock the POWER and the glory for not duplicate KANE 's success ( few film do - include all of Orson Welles ' other film ) , but I be aware that the story be present well enough to hold one 's interest to the end . and thank to the performance of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally , the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair be fully bring home . when they marry , Tom want to do well ( in part ) to give his wife and their family the benefit he never have . but in America great business success come at a cost . Tom get deeply involve with run the railroad empire ( he expand it and improve it constantly ) . but it take he away from home too much , and he lose touch with Sally . and he also notice Eve ( Helen Vinson ) , the young woman who become his mistress . when Sally learn of his unfaithful behavior it destroy she . similarly Tom too get a full shock ( which make he a martyr in the eye of Henry ) . Eve marry Tom , and present he with a son - but it turn out to be Eve 's son by Tom 's son Tom Jr. ( Philip Trent ) . the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding cause Tom to shoot himself . the film be not a total success - the action jump at time unconvincingly . yet it do make the business seem real ( note the scene when Tom tell his Board of Directors about his plan to purchase a small rival train line , and he discuss the use of debenture for finance the plan ) . Sturgis come from a wealthy background , so he could bring in this type of detail . so on the whole it be a first rate film . no citizen KANE perhaps , but of interest to movie lover as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America .",1,1,0.5279078860080555
